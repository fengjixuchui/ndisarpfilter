Overview:
---------

NdisArpFilter is a Windows NDIS firewall that processes all incoming and
outgoing network packets through a list of configured MAC address filters.

This is very much a proof-of-concept tool, and is not currently recommended for
execution outside of a virtual machine (no such testing has been performed).
If it dies with a BSOD, simply revert to the lastest snapshot!

Please email any comments, questions, bugs or suggestions to liam@int3.ws.
